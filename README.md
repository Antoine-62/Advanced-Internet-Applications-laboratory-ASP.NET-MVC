**Description :** The aim of the exercice was to familiaze withASP.NET MVC. For this, I followed the following tutorial from Microsoft : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/?view=aspnetcore-3.1  
In this description, I won't describe the code because everything is already well described in the tutorial. I'll first answer to the question, then explained the problem I met, and finally a little recap about my point of view about this technology, what I learn, what I didn't like...
